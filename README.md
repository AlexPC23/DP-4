By presenting the challenge in kaggle, 16 teams competed for 23 days to obtain the best accuracy with machine learning models. 

To do this, we had to transform the images obtained from DICOM to JPEG. 

Once transformed, the images were loaded with a size of 255 and batch size of 32. In this way the classification of the images into folders for labelling was carried out:

Using the machine learning model resnet34 we obtained an accuracy of 0.9085.
